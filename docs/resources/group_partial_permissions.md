# dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions (Resource)


Provide a partial set of permissions for a group. This is different from `dbt_cloud_group` as it allows to have multiple resources updating the same dbt Cloud group and is useful for companies managing a single dbt Cloud Account configuration from different Terraform projects/workspaces.

If a company uses only one Terraform project/workspace to manage all their dbt Cloud Account config, it is recommended to use `dbt_cloud_group` instead of `dbt_cloud_group_partial_permissions`.

~> This is currently an experimental resource and any feedback is welcome in the GitHub repository.

The current behavior of the resource is the following:

- when using `dbt_cloud_group_partial_permissions`, don't use `dbt_cloud_group` for the same group in any other project/workspace. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined and partial permissions might be removed.
- when defining a new `dbt_cloud_group_partial_permissions`
  - if the group doesn't exist with the given `name`, it will be created
  - if a group exists with the given `name`, permissions will be added in the dbt Cloud group if they are not present yet
- in a given Terraform project/workspace, avoid having different ~~dbt_cloud_group_partial_permissions` for the same group name to prevent sync issues. Add all the permissions in the same resource. 
- all resources for the same group name need to have the same values for `assign_by_default` and `sso_mapping_groups`. Those fields are not considered "partial". (Please raise feedback in GitHub if you think that `sso_mapping_groups` should be "partial" as well)
- when a resource is updated, the dbt Cloud group will be updated accordingly, removing and adding permissions
- when the resource is deleted/destroyed, if the resulting permission sets is empty, the group will be deleted ; otherwise, the group will be updated, removing the permissions from the deleted resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
// we add some permissions to the group "TF Group 1" (existing or not) to  a new project 
resource "dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions" "tf_group_1" {
	name  				= "TF Group 1"
	group_permissions = [
		{
			permission_set 	= "developer"
			project_id    	= dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
			all_projects  	= false
		},
		{
			permission_set 	= "git_admin"
			project_id    	= dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
			all_projects  	= false
		}
	]
}

// we add Admin permissions to the group "TF Group 2" (existing or not) to  a new project 
// it is possible to add more permissions to the same group name in other Terraform projects/workspaces, using another `dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions` resource
resource "dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions" "tf_group_2" {
	name  				= "TF Group 2"
	sso_mapping_groups 	= ["group2"]
	group_permissions = [
		{
			permission_set 	= "admin"
			project_id    	= dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
			all_projects  	= false
		}
	]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the group. This is used to identify an existing group

### Optional

- `assign_by_default` (Boolean) Whether the group will be assigned by default to users. The value needs to be the same for all partial permissions for the same group.
- `group_permissions` (Attributes Set) Partial permissions for the group. Those permissions will be added/removed when config is added/removed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--group_permissions))
- `sso_mapping_groups` (Set of String) Mapping groups from the IdP. At the moment the complete list needs to be provided in each partial permission for the same group.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of the group

<a id="nestedatt--group_permissions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_permissions`

Required:

- `all_projects` (Boolean) Whether access should be provided for all projects or not.
- `permission_set` (String) Set of permissions to apply. The permissions allowed are the same as the ones for the `dbtcloud_group` resource.

Optional:

- `project_id` (Number) Project ID to apply this permission to for this group.
