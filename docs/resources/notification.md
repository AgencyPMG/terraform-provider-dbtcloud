# dbtcloud_notification (Resource)




## Example Usage

```terraform
// dbt Cloud allows us to create internal and external notifications

// an internal notification will send emails to the user mentioned in `user_id`
resource "dbtcloud_notification" "my_internal_notification" {
	// user_id is the internal ID of a given user in dbt Cloud
	user_id           = 100
	on_success        = [dbtcloud_job.my_job.id]
	on_failure        = [12345]
	// the Type 1 is used for internal notifications
	notification_type = 1
}

// we can also send "external" email notifications to emails to related to dbt Cloud users
resource "dbtcloud_notification" "my_external_notification" {
	// we still need the ID of a user in dbt Cloud even though it is not used for sending notifications
	user_id           = 100
	on_failure        = [23456, 56788]
	on_cancel         = [dbtcloud_job.my_other_job.id]
	// the Type 4 is used for external notifications
	notification_type = 4
	// the external_email is the email address that will receive the notification
	external_email    = "my_email@mail.com"
}
```
