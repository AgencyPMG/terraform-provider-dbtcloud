# dbtcloud_group (Resource)

The mapping of permission names [from the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions) to the permissions to set in Terraform is the following:

|Permission name......... | Permission code|
|-- | --|
|Account Admin | account_admin|
|Account Viewer | account_viewer|
|Admin | admin|
|Analyst | analyst|
|Billing Admin | billing_admin|
|Database Admin | database_admin|
|Developer | developer|
|Git Admin | git_admin|
|Job Admin | job_admin|
|Job Runner | job_runner|
|Job Viewer | job_viewer|
|Member | member|
|Metadata Only | metadata_only|
|Owner | owner|
|Project Creator | project_creator|
|Read-Only | readonly|
|Security Admin | security_admin|
|Semantic Layer Only | semantic_layer_only|
|Stakeholder | stakeholder|
|Team Admin | team_admin|
|Webhooks Only | webhooks_only|


Provide a complete set of permissions for a group. This is different from `dbt_cloud_partial_group_permissions`.

With this resource type only one resource can be used to manage the permissions for a given group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dbtcloud_group" "tf_group_1" {
  name = "TF Group 1"
  group_permissions {
    permission_set = "member"
    all_projects   = true
  }
  group_permissions {
    permission_set = "developer"
    all_projects   = false
    project_id     = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
    writable_environment_categories = ["development", "staging"]
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the group. This is used to identify an existing group

### Optional

- `assign_by_default` (Boolean) Whether the group will be assigned by default to users. The value needs to be the same for all partial permissions for the same group.
- `group_permissions` (Block Set) Partial permissions for the group. Those permissions will be added/removed when config is added/removed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group_permissions))
- `sso_mapping_groups` (Set of String) Mapping groups from the IdP. At the moment the complete list needs to be provided in each partial permission for the same group.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of the group

<a id="nestedblock--group_permissions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_permissions`

Required:

- `all_projects` (Boolean) Whether access should be provided for all projects or not.
- `permission_set` (String) Set of permissions to apply. The permissions allowed are the same as the ones for the `dbtcloud_group` resource.

Optional:

- `project_id` (Number) Project ID to apply this permission to for this group.
- `writable_environment_categories` (Set of String) What types of environments to apply Write permissions to. 
Even if Write access is restricted to some environment types, the permission set will have Read access to all environments. 
The values allowed are `all`, `development`, `staging`, `production` and `other`. 
Not setting a value is the same as selecting `all`. 
Not all permission sets support environment level write settings, only `analyst`, `database_admin`, `developer`, `git_admin` and `team_admin`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# using  import blocks (requires Terraform >= 1.5)
import {
  to = dbtcloud_group.my_group
  id = "group_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_group.my_group
  id = "12345"
}

# using the older import command
terraform import dbtcloud_group.my_group "group_id"
terraform import dbtcloud_group.my_group 12345
```
