# dbtcloud_connection (Resource)


Create a Data Warehouse connection for your project in dbt Cloud. The connection will need to be linked to the dbt Cloud project via a `dbtcloud_project_connection` resource.
		
This resource can be used for Databricks, Postgres, Redshift, Snowflake and AlloyDB connections.
For BigQuery, due to the list of fields being very different, you can use the `dbtcloud_bigquery_connection` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dbtcloud_connection" "databricks" {
  project_id          = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type                = "adapter"
  name                = "Databricks"
  database            = "" // currenyly need to be empty for databricks
  host_name           = "my-databricks-host.cloud.databricks.com"
  http_path           = "/my/path"
  catalog             = "moo"
  // add the following for OAuth 
  oauth_client_id     = "yourclientid"
  oauth_client_secret = "yourclientsecret"
}

resource "dbtcloud_connection" "redshift" {
  project_id = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type       = "redshift"
  name       = "My Redshift Warehouse"
  database   = "my-database"
  port       = 5439
  host_name  = "my-redshift-hostname"
}

resource "dbtcloud_connection" "snowflake" {
  project_id          = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type                = "snowflake"
  name                = "My Snowflake warehouse"
  account             = "my-snowflake-account"
  database            = "MY_DATABASE"
  role                = "MY_ROLE"
  warehouse           = "MY_WAREHOUSE"
  // add the following for OAuth 
  oauth_client_id     = "yourclientid"
  oauth_client_secret = "yourclientsecret"
  allow_sso           = true
}
```
