# dbtcloud_lineage_integration (Resource)


Setup lineage integration for dbt Cloud to automatically fetch lineage from external BI tools in dbt Explorer. Currently supports Tableau.

This resource requires having an environment tagged as production already created for you project.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// the resource can only be configured when a Prod environment has been set
// so, you might want to explicitly set the dependency on your Prod environment resource

resource "dbtcloud_lineage_integration" "my_lineage" {
  project_id = dbtcloud_project.my_project.id
  host       = "my.host.com"
  site_id    = "mysiteid"
  token_name = "my-token-name"
  token      = "my-sensitive-token"

  depends_on = [dbtcloud_environment.my_prod_env]
}
```

import {
  to = dbtcloud_lineage_integration.my_lineage_integration
  id = "projet_id:lineage_integration_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_lineage_integration.my_lineage_integration
  id = "123:4567"
}

# using the older import command
terraform import dbtcloud_lineage_integration.my_lineage_integration "projet_id:lineage_integration_id"
terraform import dbtcloud_lineage_integration.my_lineage_integration 123:4567
```
