# dbtcloud Provider

~> ðŸš§ IMPORTANT! ðŸš§  
Since 0.2, resources and data sources are both available as `dbt_cloud_xxx` (legacy) and `dbtcloud_xxx` (following the Terraform convention).  
Selecting one option or the other  is done by modifying the `required_providers` configuration.

- `dbt_cloud_xxx` is kept in 0.2 for backward compatibility, but will be removed from version 0.3 onwards. Consider starting new projects with the `dbtcloud_xxx` naming convention 
- `dbtcloud_xxx` follows the Terraform naming convention and is the long term convention for the dbt Cloud configuration

## Handling the move from `dbt_cloud_xxx` (legacy) to `dbtcloud_xxx`

As those are different resources, it is not possible to move existing resources using the `terraform state mv` command.

The options are:

- keep existing projects with `dbt_cloud_xxx` resources, and create new ones with `dbtcloud_xxx`
- or update the state file manually to change the resource names (this should work but it is possible to corrupt the state, be careful and keep a backup)
  1. perform a `terrafrom apply` to apply the changes required to dbt Cloud
  1. edit the resource configuration files changing resources from `dbt_cloud_xxx` to `dbtcloud_xxx`
  1. edit `required_providers { dbt  = {` and `provider "dbt"` to `required_providers { dbtcloud  = {` and `provider "dbtcloud"`
  1. pull the remote state with `terraform state pull > remote_state.tfstate` and keep a back up of the file
  1. edit the state file to change the resource types from `dbt_cloud_xxx` to `dbtcloud_xxx`
  1. push the state back with `terraform state push remote_state.tfstate`
  1. perform a `terraform init -upgrade` to update the terraform provider
  1. perform a `terrafrom plan` to check that no change is required, you can then delete the backup of the state



## Recommended - Example with ``dbtcloud_xxx`` resources, using the `dbtcloud` provider name

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dbtcloud = {
      source  = "dbt-labs/dbtcloud"
      version = "0.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "dbtcloud" {
  account_id = var.dbt_cloud_account_id
  token      = var.dbt_cloud_token
  host_url   = "https://cloud.getdbt.com/api"
}
```

## Legacy - Example with `dbt_cloud_xxx` resources, using the `dbt` provider name

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dbt = {
      source  = "dbt-labs/dbtcloud"
      version = "0.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "dbt" {
  account_id = var.dbt_cloud_account_id
  token      = var.dbt_cloud_token
  host_url   = "https://cloud.getdbt.com/api"
}
```
