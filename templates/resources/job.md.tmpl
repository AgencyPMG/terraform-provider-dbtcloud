# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

~> As of September 2023, some CI improvements are being rolled out to dbt Cloud with minor impacts to some jobs:  [more info](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/release-notes/june-2023/ci-updates-phase1-rn). 
<br/>
<br/>
Those improvements include modifications to deferral which was historically set at the job level and will now be set at the environment level. 
Deferral can still be set to "self" by setting `self_deferring` to `true` but with the new approach, deferral to other runs need to be done with `deferring_environment_id` instead of `deferring_job_id`.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/resource.tf") }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/import.sh") }}
