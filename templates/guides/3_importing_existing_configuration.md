# 3. Importing existing configuration"

The [CLI dbtcloud-terraforming](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbtcloud-terraforming) can be used to generate the Terraform configuration files as well as import statements for existing dbt Cloud configuration.

This tool can then be used to either start managing the dbt Cloud configuration in Terraform or to replicate objects (jobs for example) between different projects or environments.
